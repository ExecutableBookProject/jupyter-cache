# jupyter-cache

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ExecutableBookProject/jupyter-cache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ExecutableBookProject/jupyter-cache)

A defined interface for working with a cache of jupyter notebooks.

Requirements:

- Persistent
- Separates out "edits to content" from "edits to code cells". Cell
  rearranges and code cell changes should require a re-execution. Content changes should not.
- Allow parallel access to of notebooks (for execution)
- Store execution statistics/reports
- Store external assets: Notebooks being executed often require external assets: importing scripts/data/etc. These are prepared by the users.
- Store execution artifacts: created during exeution
- A transparent and robust cache invalidation: imagine the user updating an external dependency or a Python module, or checking out a different git branch.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ExecutableBookProject/jupyter-cache
cd jupyter-cache
git checkout develop
pip install -e .[code_style,testing]
```

### Code Style

Code style is tested using [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org),
with the configuration set in `.flake8`,
and code formatted with [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).

Installing with `jupyter-cache[code_style]` makes the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
package available, which will ensure this style is met before commits are submitted, by reformatting the code
and testing for lint errors.
It can be setup by:

```shell
>> cd jupyter-cache
>> pre-commit install
```

Optionally you can run `black` and `flake8` separately:

```shell
>> black .
>> flake8 .
```

Editors like VS Code also have automatic code reformat utilities, which can adhere to this standard.

### Pull Requests

To contribute, make Pull Requests to the `develop` branch (this is the default branch). A PR can consist of one or multiple commits. Before you open a PR, make sure to clean up your commit history and create the commits that you think best divide up the total work as outlined above (use `git rebase` and `git commit --amend`). Ensure all commit messages clearly summarise the changes in the header and the problem that this commit is solving in the body.

Merging pull requests: There are three ways of 'merging' pull requests on GitHub:

- Squash and merge: take all commits, squash them into a single one and put it on top of the base branch.
    Choose this for pull requests that address a single issue and are well represented by a single commit.
    Make sure to clean the commit message (title & body)
- Rebase and merge: take all commits and 'recreate' them on top of the base branch. All commits will be recreated with new hashes.
    Choose this for pull requests that require more than a single commit.
    Examples: PRs that contain multiple commits with individually significant changes; PRs that have commits from different authors (squashing commits would remove attribution)
- Merge with merge commit: put all commits as they are on the base branch, with a merge commit on top
    Choose for collaborative PRs with many commits. Here, the merge commit provides actual benefits.
